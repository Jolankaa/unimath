# unimath â€” A Mathematical Environment Library in Python

**unimath** is a Python library that provides an abstract mathematical environment designed to represent and manipulate sets, intervals, and number systems in a symbolic and intuitive way. New things will continue to be added every day.

The project is developed and maintained by a **Mathematics undergraduate student at Marmara University**, with a focus on combining mathematical theory and computational representation.
