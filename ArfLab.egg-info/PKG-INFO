# ArfLab — Mathematical Environment Library in Python

  

  

**ArfLab** is a Python library that provides an abstract mathematical environment designed to represent and manipulate sets, intervals, and number systems in a symbolic and intuitive way.

  

The project is continuously growing, with new mathematical structures and operations being added every day.

  

  

Developed and maintained by a **Mathematics undergraduate student at Marmara University**, ArfLab aims to combine mathematical theory with computational representation, creating a bridge between abstract reasoning and code implementation.

## Physics

  

  

- Wave equation analysis and visualization

$$
\psi(x,y) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{L_x L_y}} \sin\left(\frac{n_x \pi x}{L_x}\right) \sin\left(\frac{n_y \pi y}{L_y}\right)
$$

-  Energy levels of a particle in a two-dimensional cubic box

$$
E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2m} (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2)
$$

```bash

Wave_Equation(Lx=2.0, Ly=1.5, nx=4, ny=1, N=100)

```

## Visualization

  

  

ArfLab includes built-in vector visualization features using **matplotlib**, allowing users to plot and analyze vector relationships directly in Python. This helps bridge the gap between symbolic manipulation and geometric intuition.

  

## Installation / Download

  

  

### PyPI (Recommended)

  

```bash

pip install ArfLab

```

### Git

  

```bash

git clone https://github.com/Jolankaa/ArfLab

cd ArfLab

pip install .

```

  

### Few Examples

```bash

import ArfLab

# Example: Creating a vector

  

v = ArfLab.Vector([1,2,3])

  

print("Magnitude:", v.magnitude())

# For visualization

v.Visualization()

  

# Example: Creating a matrix

  

m = ArfLab.Matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])

print("Determinant:", m.determinant())

```
